# redux-it-back

## Description

This is a React e-commerce app that uses GraphQL on the back-end, along with Apollo Server and MongoDB via Mongoose. It also accesses global state using Redux, which is the main topic I was exploring in this instance. In fact, the entirety of the changes between this and another repo Shop-Shop is the change from Context API to Redux. It also features a shopping cart that uses indexedDB for persistence and Stripe to handle payments on the site.

A live version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://redux-it-back.herokuapp.com/).
